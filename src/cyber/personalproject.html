      <p>
        <b>->Web research:</b> by far the part of the project that lasted the
        most, web research largely did not prove to be very useful. As it turns
        out, there is very little relevant information on the internet, mainly
        due to the sensitivity of the information. This topic is not very well
        covered on the web pages in order to prevent malicious attacks.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>->Choosing a device:</b> this took longer than expected mainly
        because i have changed my mind along the way. After consulting the
        teachers and the list of possible devices from Canvas, i decided to hack
        into a toy car, but i later switched to one of my old smartphones.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>->Bug exploit:</b> After rigurous web research on the matter, i have
        discovered a Samsung system bug and decided to exploit it. The bug
        allows the attacker to unlock the phone without typing the password.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>->Virus related work:</b> One of the very few actually useful web
        pages i have found describes the steps needed to create a virus which
        once installed on the victim's phone can get control of the camera,
        among other things. I have taken my time trying to get it to work.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>->Documentation:</b> This includes the creation of this webpage,
        along with this
        <a
          href="documents/Personal Vulnerability Investigation Research Report.docx"
          >word document</a
        >, containing in-depth information about the Personal Vulnerability
        Investigation.
